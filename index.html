        <h1>A Surfer is Born</h1>

        <p> </p>

        <p>I embarked on my surfing journey at the young age of 8 years old when I began going to a surf camp in Deal New Jersey.</p>

        <p>One of the best ways to learn to surf is to sign up for camps or private lessons as they will have equipment including wetsuits and surfboards suitable for beginners as well as friendly and experienced instructors.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>Since this day, about 10 years ago, I have surfed every chance I get, improving with each session. Even though it is always a blast, it is important to check wave reports so you know what the conditions are like before you show up to the beach. Knowing the conditions such as wave height, tide, and wind is extremely helpful for picking the proper equipment and surf spot for a given day.  </p>
        <ul>
          <h5> Here is a list of a few surf reports that can be used for beaches around the globe:</h5>

        </ul>
        <p> Being out in the surf is a truly unique and centering experience regardless of skill level or physical fitness. If you are ever feeling stressed out or depressed, find a surfboard and head to the beach. I promise you won't regret it.</p>
