        <h1>My Boards</h1>

        <p> </p>

        <p>My quiver (surfboard collection) is something that I am extremely proud of as it reflects years of improvment as a surfer and hours of standing in surf shops and garages picking selecting the perfect board. Through roughly a decade of buying, selling, and trading surfboards, about 20 unique boards have passed through my garage which currently holds about a dozen blades.</p>

        <ul>
          <h3> Here are just a few of my favorite boards along with links to online retailers:</h3>
          <li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wavestorm-Classic-Longboard-Surfboard-AZ22-WSSF800-ORG/dp/B095L2TDNS/ref=asc_df_B095L2TDNS/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=533370929451&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15450486916586020411&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9011924&hvtargid=pla-1389645365716&psc=1"> The Wavestorm</a> :The ultimate beginner surfboard package, comes with everything you need to hit the waves as a beginner. This board is made of foam -as opposed to fiberglass- so you don't have to worry about damaging it or hurting yourself while you learn to surf. A good foamie is an essential part to every quiver whether you are an advance surfer looking to goof around in some sketchy conditions, or you're giving a surf lesson to your little sister who is afraid of the ocean.
          <li> <a href="https://us.surfindustries.com/products/modern-love-child-pu-midlength-surfboard?variant=40666675413184">Modern "Love Child"</a>: A great option for beginner-intermediate surfers or smaller waves. Made by Modern Longboards: a company that emphasizes affordable yet stylish boards you can pick up for around half the price of a performance shortboard at most local shops. A great option for someone who is ready to transition off the foamtop and onto a fiberglass board with a little more maneuverability without sacrificing stability. </li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.chillisurfboards.com/surfboards/detail.php?id=4043&direct=1&region=usa">Chili A2</a>: The newest and sexiest addition to my quiver. This board falls into the category of performance shortboard, only to be used in the best of conditions by experienced surfers who want to throw buckets onto anyone who gets in their way. Boards of this caliber can be tricky to get the hang of: they're harder to paddle, less boyant, and require the surfer to generate their own speed by pumping. They can also be real pricey, my advice to get your hand on one? find someone selling a used model and pray that they have the size you're looking for. I was lucky enough to find mine from a surfboard reseller, when I picked it up I immediatly knew it was going to be my next board.</li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.sanbah.com/products/lost-surfboards-psycho-killer-carbon-wrap-surfboard">Lost Psycho Killer Carbon Wrap</a>: AKA the best Christmas gift I ever recieved, this board is a top of the line model complete with carbon fiber for extra responsivness and an extremely premium lightweight feel. But most importantly: it looks sick.</li>
