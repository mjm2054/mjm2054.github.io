        <h1>The Best Spots I've Conquered so Far</h1>

        <p> </p>

        <p>One of the most exciting aspects of surfing is picking a spot on a given day. As you visit different beaches, you start to pickup on what conditions work best at each one. You may also consider the local crowd when deciding where you are going to surf. With this list I aim to alleviate some of the stress surrounding picking a surf spot and share with you my favorite places to surf. </p>

        <ul>
          <h3> NJ Spots:</h3>
          <li> <h4> The Pipe</h4> Situated at the end of Madison Ave, Long Branch NJ, the pipe is a relatively secret spot that I consider to be my local. This wave breaks along a shallow jetty and then hits shallow sand where a sewage pipe emerges from the beach and drains out into the ocean. With the right combination of a southwest swell, west winds, and close to low tide, the pipe generates a rippable peeling right-hander that breaks fast over shallow sand. I've got a nice shot of me navigating a knee high wave pas the pipe on a sunny day riding my Love Child. pro tip: keep your mouth closed when you wipeout.</li>




          <li> <h4> Beachwalk</h4> At the north end of Sea Bright NJ, you'll find a dumpy little hotel called The Beachwalk. However, across the street is a great spot to catch some waves. You can park in the hotel's lot (if they don't catch you) and surf on one of various sandbar peaks. This is a great spot for any conditions as it will usually break at any tide or wind direction as long is there is swell and there's plenty of space so you don't have to worry about crowding. At low tide, you can get some nice A frame waves that break around 100 yards out all the way to the beach. This spot is home to Lucky Dog Surf School which is a great place to have a priate lesson or enroll in a week of surf camp. </li>

          <li><h4> Sandy Hook</h4> Gateway National Recreation Area is a protected state park that's home to multiple huge parking lots and a few good surf breaks. The best of which is located in Lot C. Once you drive through the gate you'll look for the signs with a big 'C' and park on your right. Walk out to the beach to find a huge jeti that creates a long right hand wave that breaks over rocks. This spot can get pretty crowded so be prepared to fight for your waves. </li>
          <h3> California</h3>
          <p> If you ever make it out to California be sure to take a trip to the beach and go surfing. You'll get some of the best waves in the US all year round. Because of this, the crowds are unimaginable.
          <li> <h4> Trestles</h4> San Onofre State Beach is home to some of the most renowned surfing beaches in the US including Lower Trestles. If you want to go, you'll have to park in the Carl's Jr. parking lot and walk the trail for about a half hour in the hot sun. But when I say it's worth it, I mean it. Lower Trestles is the States' most competitive surfing playground. You'll see pros out on the daily and frequent competitions. This place is a surfers paradise, once you get over the crowd. I was able to visit on vacation and it was one of the coolest experiences I've had surfing. Just make sure to stay out of the way of locals as they can get pretty territorial about their waves.
          </li>
          <li> <h4> Blacks Beach</h4> Right next to UCSD, This nude beach holds another famous break. It's a left hand wave the breaks over a spikey reef. On small days the waves are big enough to make your stomach drop during a wipeout. On big days, the waves can get to double overhead allowing for the best surfers to get barelled like crazy. To get there, you have to walk down a steep cliff that will have your legs tired before you even get in the water. I was able to visit this magical place while staying with my friend at UCSD. It's truly a dream come true once you get over the hoards of naked men laying out in the sun.
